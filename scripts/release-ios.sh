# Archive a Release build and upload it to App Store Connect in one go.
# Needs: Xcode → Settings → Accounts signed in to the developer Apple ID,
# and ios/Local.xcconfig holding DEVELOPMENT_TEAM and PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER.
#
# Build number is a timestamp so every upload is higher than the last;
# the user-visible version is MARKETING_VERSION in project.pbxproj.

# Usage: scripts/release-ios.sh [build-number]
